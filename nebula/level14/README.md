**ABOUT**

This program resides in /home/flag14/flag14. It encrypts input and writes it to standard output. An encrypted token file is also in that home directory, decrypt it :)

**Source**

No source included.  It's left up to you to figure out how the application encrypts and decrypts the data.

**Walkthrough**

See the [Walkthrough Document](./WALKTHROUGH.md) for the solution
