**Intro**

Level 06 hints that the `flag06` user was ported over from a legacy unix system.

Given this information, let's examine the user account in [`/etc/passwd`](https://kb.iu.edu/d/aezz)

```
﻿level06@nebula:~$ grep flag06 /etc/passwd
flag06:ueqwOCnSGdsuM:993:993::/home/flag06:/bin/sh
```

This could be a jackpot if the password is easy.  The password for the user appears to be here in encrypted format.

For this exercise the first thing to try is a simple dictionary attack using John the Ripper in Kali.

```
﻿root@kali:~# echo "flag06:ueqwOCnSGdsuM:993:993::/home/flag06:/bin/sh" > flag06
﻿root@kali:~# john flag06 --show
flag06:hello:993:993::/home/flag06:/bin/sh

1 password hash cracked, 0 left
```

With the password the flag can be captured.

```
﻿level06@nebula:~$ su - flag06
Password: 
flag06@nebula:~$ getflag
You have successfully executed getflag on a target account
```
