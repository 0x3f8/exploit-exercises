**ABOUT**

There is a security check that prevents the program from continuing execution if the user invoking it does not match a specific user id.

The lesson excludes all of the code as it would reveal the token function and its contents

**Source**

```
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <string.h>

#define FAKEUID 1000

int main(int argc, char **argv, char **envp)
{
  int c;
  char token[256];

  if(getuid() != FAKEUID) {
      printf("Security failure detected. UID %d started us, we expect %d\n", getuid(), FAKEUID);
      printf("The system administrators will be notified of this violation\n");
      exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
  }

  // snip, sorry :)

  printf("your token is %s\n", token);
  
}
```
