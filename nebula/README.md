
Each folder in this module presents an opportunity to view my walkthrough and learn about the various techniques I used to defeat each level or where I got help when I was stumped.


A brief summary from the [exploit-exercises](https://exploit-exercises.com/nebula/) Website for the content covered in this ISO:

Nebula takes the participant through a variety of common (and less than common) weaknesses and vulnerabilities in Linux. It takes a look at

* SUID files
* Permissions
* Race conditions
* Shell meta-variables
* $PATH weaknesses
* Scripting language weaknesses
* Binary compilation failures

Anyone wanting to tackle this ISO should use the link above and load it up in VirtualBox or your favorite VM application.  I'd also recommend bringing [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/) up in a parallel VM on the same network.  You won't be able to copy and paste from the Nebula console or that was an issue I had with VirtualBox anyway.
