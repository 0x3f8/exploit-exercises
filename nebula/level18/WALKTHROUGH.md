**Intro**

I need to circle back around on this level.  I was unable to solve it on my own despite going down some of the right paths.


Instead I read over the following walkthroughs

[V0id s3curity - Format String Bypass](http://v0ids3curity.blogspot.com.es/2012/09/exploit-exercise-format-string.html)

[V0id s3curity - Defeating ASLR using Information Leak](http://v0ids3curity.blogspot.com.es/2012/09/defeating-aslr-using-information-leak.html)

[Forelsec BlogSpot - All Walkthroughs](http://forelsec.blogspot.com.es/2013/03/nebula-solutions-all-levels.html)

Given that I originally did this challenge a couple of years ago I definitely want to go back and give it another shot with minimal references to the other walkthroughs
