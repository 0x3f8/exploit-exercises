**ABOUT**

There is a vulnerability in the below program that allows arbitrary programs to be executed, can you find it?

The objective is to execute `/bin/getflag` as a *flag* account 

**Source**

```
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv, char **envp)
{
  char *buffer;

  gid_t gid;
  uid_t uid;

  gid = getegid();
  uid = geteuid();

  setresgid(gid, gid, gid);
  setresuid(uid, uid, uid);

  buffer = NULL;

  asprintf(&buffer, "/bin/echo %s is cool", getenv("USER"));
  printf("about to call system(\"%s\")\n", buffer);
  
  system(buffer);
}
```
