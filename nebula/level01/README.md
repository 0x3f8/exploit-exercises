**ABOUT**

There is a vulnerability in the below program that allows arbitrary programs to be executed, can you find it?

The objective is to execute `/bin/getflag` as a *flag* account 

**Source**

```
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv, char **envp)
{
  gid_t gid;
  uid_t uid;
  gid = getegid();
  uid = geteuid();

  setresgid(gid, gid, gid);
  setresuid(uid, uid, uid);

  system("/usr/bin/env echo and now what?");
}

**Walkthrough**

See the [Walkthrough Document](./WALKTHROUGH.md) for the solution
