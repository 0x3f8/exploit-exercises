**Intro**

Level 00 is an exceptionally simple example of a file with the SUID bit set.

You can learn more about SUID at the [Linux Juggernaut website](http://www.linuxnix.com/suid-set-suid-linuxunix/)

The brief explanation is that SUID/SGID files run as the user o group that owns the file, rather than the user that executed the file.

In some cases this is necessary because something needs to be executable by a normal user but has to modify system files.  The *nix passwd command is a good example of a file that edits system files but is run by non-priviledged users.

This level gives us an opportunity to learn how to find these types of files.

**Find the file**

```
flag00@nebula:$ find / -perm /u=s -user flag00 -fprintf /tmp/suid.txt "%#m %u %p\n"
```

This command will find each file that is
- suid
- owned by the user
- accessible by the current user

The list of files will be in /tmp/suid.txt

```
flag00@nebula:$ cat /tmp/suid.txt
04750 flag00 /bin/.../flag00
04750 flag00 /rofs/bin/.../flag00
```

Running the command to see what it does generates the following output

```
flag00@nebula:$ /bin/.../flag00
Congrats, now run getflag to get your flag!
```

Which yields the following following results

```
flag00@nebula:$ getflag
You have successfully executed getflag on a target account
```
