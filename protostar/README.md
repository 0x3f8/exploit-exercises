Each folder in this module presents an opportunity to view my walkthrough and learn about the various techniques I used to defeat each level or where I got help when I was stumped.


A brief summary from the [exploit-exercises](https://exploit-exercises.com/protostar/) Website for the content covered in this ISO:

Nebula takes the participant through a variety of common (and less than common) weaknesses and vulnerabilities in Linux. It takes a look at
Protostar introduces the following in a friendly way:

* Network programming
* Byte order
* Handling sockets
* Stack overflows
* Format strings
* Heap overflows

The above is introduced in a simple way, starting with simple memory corruption and modification, function redirection, and finally executing custom shellcode.

Anyone wanting to tackle this ISO should use the link above and load it up in VirtualBox or your favorite VM application.  I'd also recommend bringing [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/) up in a parallel VM on the same network.  You won't be able to copy and paste from the Nebula console or that was an issue I had with VirtualBox anyway.
