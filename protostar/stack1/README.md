**About**

This level looks at the concept of modifying variables to specific
values in the program, and how the variables are laid out in memory.

Setting the values to something specific will become more important in
later challenges since we'll want to point vulnerable applications to
our exploit code.  More commentary around the memory addresses will be
provided in those later challenges.

**Source**
```
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  volatile int modified;
  char buffer[64];

  if(argc == 1) {
      errx(1, "please specify an argument\n");
  }

  modified = 0;
  strcpy(buffer, argv[1]);

  if(modified == 0x61626364) {
      printf("you have correctly got the variable to the right value\n");
  } else {
      printf("Try again, you got 0x%08x\n", modified);
  }
}
```
